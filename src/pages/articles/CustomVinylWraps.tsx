## What is Vinyl Wrapping?

Vinyl wrapping is the process of applying a thin, adhesive-backed film to your vehicle's exterior surfaces. This film can change the color, add graphics, or create unique designs while protecting the underlying paint from UV damage, minor scratches, and environmental contaminants.

### How Vinyl Wrapping Works
The process involves carefully applying pre-cut vinyl sheets to your vehicle's body panels. The vinyl is heated and stretched to conform to complex curves and contours, creating a seamless finish that looks like a factory paint job.
